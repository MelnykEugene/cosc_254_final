ToDo's:
update hashapriori description, mention the fact that leafs are linked into a list.
	
evaluating runtime of hashapriori as a function of branhcing factor

Minsup thresholds that don't result in frequent itemsets of lenth >=3 are not meaningful. Edit our graphs accordingly?

Note*
All algorithms have an argument for minsup, that is prrovided by the user when they are run. dEclat has an argument for dataset pathname and minsu, in that order.
